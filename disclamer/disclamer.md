* [x] We at BabyElonSwap, which is being explained in this conceptual document, is not a licensed financial document, or license inset or payment services of any kind or any jurisdiction, so all terms used in this document or website are intended only as a basic reference, without any actual or legal meaning of the same. BabyElonSwap is totally focused on our community, and not shareholders or any function or entity that exercises forms of governance. Our BabyElonSwap contract is completely open, audited to validate its security, and totally permanent, not to be modified at any time. Our $BSE token is useful in all jurisdictions and cannot be considered as "security" as it is not in any form of e-money or fiat money. Our white paper is not a contract or a contractual agreement of any kind, not even an invitation to invest in $BSE, and our investor acknowledges and accepts that there is a risk in accessing, acquiring or using any type of blockchain or cryptographic system, token and platform, and we reject any claim of any kind from any member of the community directly or indirectly involving BabyElonSwap, for any damages suffered, including total loss. For this reason we make available on the website information inherent to the credit cards, where it is of total convenience for investors to acquire them.
