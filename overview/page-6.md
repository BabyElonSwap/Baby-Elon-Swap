Baby Doge is cute but with a lot of BITE! $Baby Doge is a deflationary token designed to become more scarce over time. All holders of Baby Doge will earn more baby doge that is automatically sent to your wallet by simply holding Baby Doge coins in your wallet. Watch the amount of baby doge grow in your wallet as baby doge coin holders automatically receive a 5% fee from every on chain transaction that happens on the Baby Doge ecosystem. The community receives more baby doge coins from the fees generated each transaction.

### AUTO BURN

The dead wallet holds 45%+ of the supply. That means out of the 5% of the reflections 45%+ of them will be distributed to the dead wallet each transaction. Thus, coins are burned with each on chain transaction.

### AUTO-REFLECTIONS

5% fee of each transaction is redistributed to token holders. That means you can earn more Baby Doge Coins by holding them in your wallet. (centralized exchanges/wallets may not apply tokenomics)

### LOCKED LIQUIDITY

Majority of initial LP tokens locked & some burned. (Newly generated LP tokens from the 5% LP fees are not)

### CHARITY WALLET

We have a designated charity wallet that receives redistributions that are used to support our charity partners.
