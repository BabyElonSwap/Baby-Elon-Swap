:tada: The development of the BabyElonSwap token was born from a simple initial concept; to provide investors with opportunity to invest in a cryptocurrency that puts their needs and goals at the forefront and goals at the forefront, and set a new benchmark within the the crypto space for transparency and accountability.\
:tada: Baby Elon ($BSE) is a hyper-deflationary cryptocurrency token, on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which investor pays holders, and a spectacular 15% on Binance USA Dollars (BUSD) a stable currency that is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. This 15% reward is applied to all purchases, sales and transactions, distributing wealth consistently.\
:tada: BabyElonSwap is structured to operate and function as a business, and not as someone's someone's hobby or sidehutle. This means that the main function of the core team is to gather and use talent when and as needed, for the most efficient cost, in the shortest time possible, achieve the best TCO and ROI. To be frank, BabyElonSwap is here to make money for its investors and for itself.

### REWARDS

### NFT MARKTPLACE

:tada: Our largest project in the works is our NFT marketplace. We will allow users to create and buy/auction their own NFTs

### BURN

:tada: The BSE token is hyper-deflationary, so we adopted a strategy of repurchasing tokens after launch and burning them, bringing our investors a higher valuation
